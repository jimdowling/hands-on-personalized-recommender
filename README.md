## 🎯 About This Course

This hands-on course teaches you how to build and deploy a real-time personalized recommender system for H&M fashion articles. You'll learn:

- A practical 4-stage recommender architecture
- Two-tower model implementation and training
- Scalable ML system design principles
- MLOps best practices
- Real-time model deployment
- LLM-enhanced recommendations
- Building an interactive web interface

## 👥 Target Audience

**This course is ideal for:**
- ML/AI engineers interested in building production-ready recommender systems
- Data Engineers, Data Scientists, and Software Engineers wanting to understand the engineering behind recommenders

**Note:** This course focuses on engineering practices and end-to-end system implementation rather than theoretical model optimization or research.

## 🎓 Prerequisites

| Category | Requirements |
|----------|-------------|
| **Skills** | Basic knowledge of Python and Machine Learning |
| **Hardware** | Any modern laptop/workstation will do the job (no GPU or powerful computing power required). |
| **Level** | Intermediate |


## 💰 Cost Structure

All tools used throughout the course will stick to their free tier, except OpenAI's API, as follows:

- Lessons 1-4: Completely free
- Lesson 5 (Optional): ~$1-2 for OpenAI API usage when building LLM-enhanced recommenders

## 📚 Course

This **self-paced course** consists of **5 comprehensive modules** covering theory, system design, and hands-on implementation.

Our recommendation for each module:
1. Read the article
2. Run the Notebook (locally or on Colab)
3. Go deeper into the code

## 🏗️ Project Structure

At Decoding ML we teach how to build production ML systems, thus the course follows the structure of a real-world Python project:

```bash
.
├── notebooks/          # Jupyter notebooks for each pipeline
├── recsys/             # Core recommender system package
│   ├── config.py       # Configuration and settings
│   ...
│   └── training/       # Training pipelines code
├── tools/              # Utility scripts
├── streamlit_app.py    # Streamlit app entry point
├── .env.example        # Example environment variables template
├── Makefile            # Commands to install and run the project
├── pyproject.toml      # Project dependencies
```

## 🌐 Live Demo

Try out our deployed H&M real-time personalized recommender:
[💻 Live Streamlit Demo](https://decodingml-hands-on-personalized-recommender.streamlit.app/)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The demo is in 0-cost mode, which means that when there is no traffic, the deployment scales to 0 instances. The first time you interact with it, give it 1-2 minutes to warm up to 1+ instances. Afterward, everything will become smoother.

## 🚀 Getting Started

For detailed installation and usage instructions, see our [INSTALL_AND_USAGE](https://github.com/decodingml/hands-on-personalized-recommender/blob/main/INSTALL_AND_USAGE.md) guide.

**Recommendation:** While you can follow the installation guide directly, we strongly recommend reading the accompanying articles to gain a complete understanding of the recommender system.
